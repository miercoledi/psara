there are three line-breaks above this line, and will be four below it.



i've set the markup language to handle linebreaks such that an instance of two calls for insertion of a newline at the display. but now i'm wondering if i need to set special rules for odd numbers, etcetera.


maybe it could be cool to just call an \"i'm done with this section\" type thing or [i]whatever[/i] by indicating it at the end of a line, meaning at the end of a line in the sense of a regular expression, not at the end of a line as marked by punctuation.  for example, perhaps the following syntax could end this segment of the string and prepare for a new one!$

why not call commands like that, with an exclamation point followed by a single character? it's simple and clean. here would be another.!$

i will leave this one, and do one line break before doing the syntax that would indicate it's the [i]beginning[/i] of a new segment.
!^so this would be a new segment, as indicated by the ! followed by a ^.

there are two newlines before this sentence, the markup ought to turn that into a visible linebreak in the html.

remember we're using the :cl-markup package so we may need to change something such that the results of a (format-this-log-entry) or whatever are printed using (markup::raw) else the post-markup-processing html may not show up. but that's later.

one gigantic feature we need to begin working on sometime in the near, if not imminent, future is an administration panel. it should be used to configure a new instance of psara, as well as to add, subtract, install, download, upload etc various widgets, addons, features, themes, all-that-jazz that will make up the soon-to-be-beautiful commonlisp w3 setup known as the psara-suite. and sweet will it be indeed."
